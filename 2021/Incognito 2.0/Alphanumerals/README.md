856419 1078119 885788332 18698824

## Solution

Searching for alphanumeric cipher, we get the link to [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/base-36-cipher)

Putting the given values, in the input and decrypting we get:

`ICTF N3VR ENDING B4S3S`

Changing it to match the flag format of CTF, we get the flag:

`ICTF{N3VR_ENDING_B4S3S}`
