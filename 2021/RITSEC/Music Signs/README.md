## Challenge

Geno occasionally keeps up with his exâ€™s music interests. What do they say about her personality?

Author: Brendy

## Solution

Searching for Geno Ikomonov, we get the second result as a their Facebook Profile. In the Intro section we can see something saying :

> It's been complicated with Claire Alexa

From this we know that Claire Alexa is Geno's ex. I did not find anything particularly interesting in her Facebook profile. Then I searched her name on Twitter. In her Twitter Bio, there is a link to her spotify profile.

Keep in mind that you need to be logged in to see the flag.

Observing her playlist, we can see that name of the playlist is RS and if we check the first letters of all the songs in the playlist it comes out to be `SAGITTARIUS`.

From this our flag becomes:

`RS{SAGITTARIUS}`
