## Solution

We are giving the first name of the person as **Geno** and that he works in a place called **Bridgewater**. Searching for `Geno Bridgewater`, we get the first result as a LinkedIn Profile saying :

```
geno ikonomov
Financial Intelligence Analyst at Bridgewater Investigations
Batavia, New York, United States
```

The challenge asked to wrap the last name in RS{} so our flag becomes:

`RS{ikonomov}`
