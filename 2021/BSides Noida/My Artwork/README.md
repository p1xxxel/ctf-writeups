## Challenge

"You can create art and beauty with a computer." - Steven Levy
So, I decided not to use MS Paint anymore and write code instead!
Hope you can see my art before the turtle runs away!
He's pretty fast tbh!
PS: Put the flag in BSNoida{} wrapper.

Attachment : art.TURTLE

Looking at the commands and searching them I find that they are syntax of MSW Logo so I download MSW Logo and execute the repeat commands one by one.

Doing so we get 
```bash
CODE_IS_BEAUTY_BEAUTY_IS_CODE
```

So our flag becomes
```bash
BSNoida{CODE_IS_BEAUTY_BEAUTY_IS_CODE}
```
