#### Nmap Scan
Scanning for ports, we see that there are only 2 ports open : 22 and 80.

#### Directory scan
Scanning for directories with the given [wordlst](https://github.com/p1xxxel)

```bash
index.html              [Status: 200, Size: 4173, Words: 1633, Lines: 104]

```

At `ryuk.apples`, there is a ssh private key but it has a passphrase.

#### Cracking ssh key
We can use `ssh2john` and then crack it with john using the given wordlist.

Now we can use this to login as `ryuk`

#### Cracking shadow
We see in ryuk's home directory there is shadow and passwd.

Using them, we get the password of `light`

#### Getting flag
Doing a `sudo -l`, we can run `cat` as root so we can just cat the flag at `/root/root.txt`

<img src="https://github.com/p1xxxel/ctf-writeups/blob/main/2021/BSides%20Noida/Death%20Note/getting_flag.png">

So the flag is `BSNoida{Pr1vEsc_w4a_E4sy_P3a5y}`
